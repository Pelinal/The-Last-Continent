BM_LAST_CONTINENT_DESC;It is the beginning of the year 2120, precisely 20 years after the collapse of global civilisation. The unprecendented effects of global warming caused a mass exacuation of all COMNAP member nations as well as a few nations who could muster enough funds to flee their now arid homelands were sent to Antarctica to carry on human civilisation until we could make it to the stars... 20 years have passed since then and the political situation on the now thawed continent is quite extraordinary.\nWill nations attempt save their people and make it to Mars?
